## RobertJN64 Solutions

All solutions were written with no assistance from forums.
Solutions are not necessarily optimal - but many use interesting
techniques.

The repo also contains the template file I used, as well as the scripts
to launch each part quickly.

Summary:
 - `#TODO`

Thoughts on Puzzles:
 - Day 1: Much harder than last year, overlapping strings made my first solution fail
 - Day 2: Fun puzzle, great score!
 - Day 3: Annoying puzzle (because I scored poorly), so many off by 1 errors...
 - Day 4: Straightforward, clever twist

Overall - `#TODO`
